# Week/Season Selector Restored ✅

## What Was Fixed

The week and season selector UI that was accidentally removed has been fully restored to the Dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Dashboard.jsx** - Added Week/Season Selector UI
Added a complete selector interface between the tabs and content sections:
- **Season Dropdown**: Select 2024 or 2025 season
- **Week Dropdown**: Select weeks 1-18
- **Refresh Button**: Manually trigger data refresh

The selector is visually styled with:
- Purple/pink gradient theme matching the app
- Icons for better UX (📅 for season, 🗓️ for week, 🔄 for refresh)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Disabled state on refresh button when loading

### 2. **App.css** - Added Complete Styling
Added comprehensive CSS for the new selector:
- `.week-season-selector` - Main container with backdrop blur and shadows
- `.selector-group` - Individual selector units with flexbox layout
- `.selector-dropdown` - Styled dropdowns with hover/focus states
- `.refresh-button` - Gradient button with animations
- Mobile responsive styles for screens under 640px

### 3. **Removed Duplicate Navigation**
The Dashboard component had a duplicate navigation bar that should only exist in App.jsx:
- Removed `<nav className="app-nav">` from Dashboard.jsx
- Navigation is now only in App.jsx (as it should be for routing)

## How It Works

```javascript
// State management (already existed)
const [selectedSeason, setSelectedSeason] = useState(2025);
const [selectedWeek, setSelectedWeek] = useState(6);

// Automatically fetches data when season/week changes
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, [selectedSeason, selectedWeek]);
```

## UI Structure

```
