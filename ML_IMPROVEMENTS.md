### 4. Model Version Fixes
**Status:** ⚠️ Addressed through retraining

**Issue:** RandomForest and XGBoost models saved with sklearn 1.3.2, loading with 1.7.2

**Solution:**
1. Retrain all models with current sklearn version
2. Save models using `joblib.dump()` with current environment
3. Use XGBoost's native `Booster.save_model()` for better compatibility

**Implementation:** Handled automatically in `scripts/train_enhanced_models.py`

### 5. Real-Time Odds Integration
**Status:** 🔜 Prepared for implementation

**Note:** This requires external API subscription (The Odds API, Odds API, etc.)

**Prepared Features:**
- `odds_spread` - Point spread from betting markets
- `odds_over_under` - Total points over/under line
- `odds_moneyline_home` - Moneyline odds for home team
- `odds_moneyline_away` - Moneyline odds for away team

**Integration Points:**
1. Create `src/odds_collector.py` module
2. Add odds columns to database schema
3. Integrate into `DataCollector` class
4. Update feature engineering to include odds features

**Recommended APIs:**
- The Odds API (https://the-odds-api.com/) - $39/month
- Odds API (https://oddsapi.io/) - Free tier available
- RapidAPI Sports Odds - Various pricing

### 6. Player Injury Data
**Status:** 🔜 Simplified implementation ready

**Current Implementation:**
